    <h1>Scott's Favorite Animal</h1>
    <p>My favorite animal is the wolverine. The wolverine is a land mammel, similar to a badger or small bear. It is
        known for its poor temperment and extreme strength. It is infamous for being able take down prey many times its
        own size. Despite this, wolverines are primarily scavengers.</p>
    <p>Wolverines are found primarily in the Northern Hemisphere, close to the Arctic Circle. Unfortunately, they have
        primarily fone extinct in Europe, with the exception of Scandinavia. In North America, wolverines are primarily
        found in Canada, with a few small populations inhabiting northern US states.</p>
    <p>The wolverine is well known in sports and popular culture. It is usually associated with the Marvel Comics
        character, Wolverine, whom is a mainstay in the X-Men franchise. In the sporting world, the wolverine is used as
        the mascot for the University of Michigan (my alma mater).</p>
